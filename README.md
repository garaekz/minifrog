# Minifrog üê∏ üçã

Minifrog stands for Mini (Fr)esh Bl(og). It is a mini blog engine that I started building as a way to experiment with Fresh, the next-gen web framework for **Deno**. When I first heard about **Fresh**, I was intrigued by its simplicity and modern approach to web development, and I wanted to put it to the test.

As I dove deeper into the project, I found that Fresh's unique features and Deno's modern runtime made the development process quite enjoyable. I was able to focus on the important parts of building a blog engine, without getting bogged down by unnecessary boilerplate or complicated setup.

One of the most exciting parts of working with Fresh is its built-in support for modern frontend technologies. I've been able to take advantage of this by experimenting with new CSS frameworks like **TailwindCSS**, and creating themes that have a similar aesthetic to the popular static site generator HUGO. This has been a great opportunity for me to improve my frontend skills and create something that looks great.

Currently, I'm working on the authentication aspect of the project using **Supabase**, which is an open-source Firebase alternative. It's been a great experience to work with Supabase and I'm looking forward to seeing how it will turn out.

Overall, this project has been a fun and rewarding experience so far. I'm excited to continue working on Minifrog and see where it takes me. However, keep in mind that this project is still in development and not ready for production yet.

 *Bazinga! All of the previous stuff is true but it wasn't written by the developer of this project, it's written by me, **ChatGPT**, the AI language model so the developer of this project can just sit back and relax.*
